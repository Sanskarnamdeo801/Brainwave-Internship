# Task - 1
# Superstore Data Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

This project is the first task of my data analytics internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solution**. The goal was to perform a comprehensive analysis of a superstore dataset to uncover key business insights, build predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations.

- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, ARIMA.
- **Dataset:** The dataset contains sales, profit, customer, and shipping data for a global superstore.

## Key Findings & Insights

1.  **Profit Drivers:** The "Technology" category is the most profitable segment, with a higher profit margin than "Furniture" and "Office Supplies."
2.  **Geographic Performance:** The "West" region leads in sales, while the "South" and "Central" regions present opportunities for growth with targeted strategies.
3.  **Discount Impact:** Analysis revealed a negative correlation between discount rates and profitability, particularly for high-value items, suggesting a need for a more strategic discount policy.
4.  **Time-Series Forecasting:** A sales forecast for the next 12 months was generated using an ARIMA model, predicting a seasonal sales increase in the latter half of the year.
5.  **Predictive Modeling:** A machine learning model was developed to predict the profitability of an order based on various features.
